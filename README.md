# Drawing self-collidable L-systems
What if you could visualize an agent path governed by an L-system that spawns (randomly) other agents that also follow the same L-system grammar but also can not cross a path once traveled?  

This is a question no one has asked, but this program has answered.

Useful? No.  
Cool background generator? Yes.
